## Aircraft and instruments
There are to kinds of supported aircraft:
* **Basic** - allow assigning all G-Keys of Logitech devices to aircraft's instruments in the cockpit (all clickable cockpits supported by DCS-BIOS)
* **Advanced** - additionally can display some information on LCD (listed below)

Why a such way? Basically advanced support is for aircraft that I own and therefore can test it.
