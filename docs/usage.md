# Starting
## Single file download (new way)
1. Run Logitech Gaming Software (it allows accessing LCD)
2. Double click at downloaded file.
3. Click `Start`
4. LCD should update with dcspy basic info, waiting to connect to DCS 
5. Run DCS and start any mission.

## via pip (old way)
1. Run Logitech Gaming Software (it allows accessing LCD)
2. You can check with `pip uninstall dcspy` (**NOTE!** answer **No** to question) where dcspy was installed. Usually pip should install dcspy into your python directory: i.e.:
   * `d:\projects\venvs\dcspy\lib\site-packages\dcspy-3.0.0.dist-info\*`
   * `d:\projects\venvs\dcspy\lib\site-packages\dcspy\*`
   * `d:\projects\venvs\dcspy\scripts\dcspy.exe`
   * `d:\projects\venvs\dcspy\scripts\dcspy_cli.exe`
3. You can drag and drop `dcspy.exe` or `dcspy_cli.exe` to desktop and make shortcut (with custom icon, you can find icon in installation directory i.e. `d:\projects\venvs\dcspy\lib\site-packages\dcspy\img\dcspy.ico`).
   * `dcspy.exe` - with open directly GUI window
   * `dcspy_cli.exe` - additionally start console window (with logs)
4. Double-click on dcspy icon or type `dcspy.exe`\`dcspy_cli.exe` from Command Prompt
5. Click `Start`
6. LCD should update with dcspy basic info, waiting to connect to DCS 
7. Run DCS and start any mission.

**Note:** DCS can already running, before starting LGS and or DCSpy.

**Note:** If you upgrade DCSpy before version 1.7.0 `dcspy.ico` and `config.yaml` were in data directory like `c:\python312\dcspy_data\` but location is deperched in Python if you still have it, you can safely delete it

# Mono vs. Color
DCSpy do not use full potential of G19, which support full RGBA, 8-lines LCD.  
In contrast to mono devices (like G13, G15 and G510), which support mono, 4-lines LCD.

## LCD buttons
G19 has 7  buttons.  
In contrast to mono devices (like G13, G15 and G510) has only 4 buttons.  
Way in which actions assign to button for G13 (4 buttons form left to right) are mapped to G19 looks:  
* G13 1st button -> G19 left button
* G13 2nd button -> G19 right button
* G13 3rd button -> G19 down button
* G13 4th button -> G19 up button

Right now LCD buttons are hardcoded in DCSpy and its function depends on currently loaded aircraft. This will change in future.

## G-keys
From DCSpy 3.0 it is possible to use all keyboard's G-Keys:
* G19 - 12 keys
* G510 - 18 keys
* G15 v1 - 18 keys
* G15 v2 - 6 keys
* G13 - 29 keys

You can assign almost any input controller from cockpit for aircraft supported by DCS-BIOS. Note: DCS-BIOS has to provide input protocol.

### How to setup:
* Install Git: https://git-scm.com/download/win (any 64-Bit, default options should be fine)
* Set **DCS-BIOS** folder  
  ie. (D:/Users/wags/Saved Games/DCS.openbeta/Scripts/DCS-BIOS)
* Set checked **Use live DCS-BIOS version** (can take 20+ sec)
* Click **Start** and then **Stop** (in rare cases is needed)
* Open LGS, new profile should be added (current dcspy file name: ie. dcspy_cli_3.0.0)

* Set this profile default and optionally persistent. Close LGS.

* Go to **G-Keys** tab, additionally turn on **View** / **Show G-Keys** extra dialog
* Select plane from combo box up right corner 
* assign any controllers to G-Key/Modes
* Use save icon to save plane configuration

# Configuration
All settings can be configured directly via GUI. However,  more advanced users can change configuration file `config.yaml` file. It is located in user's AppData directory (e.g. `C:\Users\<user_name>\AppData\Local\dcspy\config.yaml`). 
This is simple file, most users do not need to touch it at all. Configuring DCSpy enable some powerful features of DCSpy.
