# Live DCS-BIOS
The easiest way to use this feature is from DCSpy, but you need [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) installed. It is possible download live version manually from GitHub and place in Save Games folder, but you need do it every time you want update latest changes of DCS-BIOS.

When enable DCSpy will use live/git version of DCS-BIOS. It is like DCS OpenBeta vs. Stable.

When you switch to live version for first time be patient DCSpy will download repository (ca. 150 MB it can take a few seconds), freeze can be expected.

This is recommended way using DCS-BIOS by its developers.

DCSpy basically copy latest changes from DCS-BIOS repository into your `Save Games` folder, so every time you run DCSpy (when `Auto Update DCS-BIOS` is enable as well) latest commit from GitHub will be fetched.

Another option you can specify is `DCS-BIOS Git reference`, where `master` (recommended default value) means latest commit. But you can use any branch or commit ID.
